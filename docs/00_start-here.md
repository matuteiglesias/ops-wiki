## Purpose
This wiki is a small internal manual to run a multi project life with low re entry friction. It is an API reference for an execution system, not a narrative journal.

## What this system is
- A loop that turns projects into computable checks and evidence
- A block based day clock that selects a single mode per block
- A verification culture: progress counts only when evidence exists

## What this system is not
- A place to brainstorm endlessly
- A place to store every thought
- A replacement for doing the work

## How to use the wiki in 60 seconds
1) Read the [One Pager Spec](spec-one-pager) to reorient
2) Pick a block and choose a mode in [Day Clock and Selection](day-clock-selection)
3) Run legal operators and produce evidence, then update frontier
